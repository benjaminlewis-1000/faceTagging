Installing DLIB with CUDA can be tricky. Here are some helpful tips:

-This page gives basic commands. http://leadtosilverlining.blogspot.com/2018/08/build-and-install-dlib-with-cuda.html
- You need to add a -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH that points to your cudnn libraries
- You will need to add CUDA to your path:  export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:"$PATH" (preferably in .bashrc)
- Same thing when running python setup.py -- add to the DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH. 
- For example: 

sudo python3 setup.py install --set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/cuda  --set CUDA_HOST_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc-6  --clean
